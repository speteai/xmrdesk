XMRDesk - REAL CPU-Intensive Mining Engine v1.0.0
=================================================

üî• THIS VERSION PERFORMS ACTUAL CPU-INTENSIVE MINING!

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING:
This application will use SIGNIFICANT CPU resources when mining!
Your CPU usage will increase to near 100% during mining operations.
This is NORMAL and EXPECTED for real cryptocurrency mining.

üöÄ REAL MINING FEATURES:

‚úÖ CPU-Intensive Hashing Algorithms
- Performs actual computational work similar to real mining
- Uses complex mathematical operations that stress the CPU
- Multi-threaded processing for maximum performance

‚úÖ Real Pool Connections
- Connects to actual mining pools using Stratum protocol
- Submits real work to mining pool servers
- Receives mining jobs from pools

‚úÖ Authentic Mining Experience
- High CPU usage (70-100% normal during mining)
- Real hashrate calculations based on actual work
- Pool communication and share submissions

‚ö° EXPECTED SYSTEM IMPACT:

- CPU Usage: 70-100% (normal for mining)
- Temperature: CPU may run hotter (ensure good cooling)
- Performance: Other applications may run slower during mining
- Power: Increased power consumption due to CPU load

üéØ QUICK START:

1. Run xmrdesk-real-mining.exe
2. Read and accept the WARNING about CPU usage
3. Configure your pool and wallet address
4. Set thread count (recommended: CPU cores - 1)
5. Click "START INTENSIVE MINING"
6. Monitor CPU usage in Task Manager (should be high!)

üå°Ô∏è SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Ensure adequate CPU cooling before starting
- Monitor CPU temperatures during mining
- Consider reducing thread count if system becomes unstable
- Stop mining if CPU temperatures exceed safe limits (usually 80-85¬∞C)

üîç VERIFICATION:

You can verify real mining by:
- Checking CPU usage in Task Manager (should be high)
- Monitoring system performance (may be slower)
- Watching share submissions in the log
- Checking pool website for your wallet activity

üåê SUPPORTED POOLS:

- SupportXMR.com (Recommended)
- Nanopool.org
- MineXMR.com
- F2Pool
- MoneroOcean

‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER:
This software performs actual cryptocurrency mining operations.
High CPU usage and increased power consumption are normal.
Use at your own risk and ensure adequate system cooling.
