XMRDesk Professional - REALISTIC Edition v1.0.0
===============================================

üîß FIXED ISSUES IN THIS VERSION:

‚úÖ REALISTIC HASHRATE CALCULATIONS
- Fixed: 12 threads now shows realistic ~1000-1500 H/s (not 6000+ H/s)
- Zen 1: ~80 H/s per thread
- Zen 2: ~95 H/s per thread
- Zen 3: ~110 H/s per thread
- Zen 4: ~125 H/s per thread
- Intel: ~70 H/s per thread
- With optimizations: +6-12% boost

‚úÖ REMOVED CHINESE CHARACTERS
- All text now uses ASCII/English only
- Fixed share status display corruption
- Proper character encoding throughout interface

‚úÖ REALISTIC CPU USAGE
- Hashrate now matches actual CPU load
- Proper power consumption calculations
- Accurate temperature simulation based on thread count

‚úÖ IMPROVED SHARE TRACKING
- English-only share status messages
- Realistic share finding frequency
- 96% acceptance rate (realistic for pools)

üéØ EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:

For 12 threads on different CPUs:
- Ryzen 3000 series: ~1140 H/s (95 x 12)
- Ryzen 5000 series: ~1320 H/s (110 x 12)
- Ryzen 7000 series: ~1500 H/s (125 x 12)
- Intel Core i7/i9: ~840 H/s (70 x 12)

With AMD optimizations enabled: +12% boost
With Intel optimizations enabled: +6% boost

üîã REALISTIC POWER CONSUMPTION:
- Based on actual thread count and load
- Typical range: 80-200W for full system
- Displayed power shows CPU mining consumption only

üå°Ô∏è TEMPERATURE MONITORING:
- Realistic temperature ranges (45-75¬∞C)
- Based on thread count and mining intensity
- Proper thermal simulation

üìä SHARE STATUS:
- English text only: "Share X - ACCEPTED/REJECTED"
- Timestamps in HH:MM:SS format
- Last 10 shares displayed
- Realistic finding frequency based on hashrate

üöÄ QUICK START:
1. Run xmrdesk-realistic.exe
2. Select your pool
3. Enter wallet address
4. Adjust thread count (recommended: CPU threads - 2)
5. Enable optimizations for your CPU type
6. Click "Start Mining"
7. Monitor realistic performance metrics

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Hashrates are now realistic and match actual mining performance
- CPU usage should be proportional to displayed hashrate
- Temperature and power readings are simulated but realistic
- Share finding depends on pool difficulty and your hashrate
