‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: REAL MINING - Uses 100% CPU, generates heat!

SUPPORTED POOLS:
================

‚Ä¢ SupportXMR (Recommended) - pool.supportxmr.com:3333
‚Ä¢ Nanopool - xmr-eu1.nanopool.org:14433
‚Ä¢ MoneroHash - monerohash.com:2222
‚Ä¢ MineXMR - pool.minexmr.com:4444

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
=========================

‚Ä¢ Platform: Windows 7/8/10/11 (64-bit)
‚Ä¢ Executable Size: 2.7MB (statically linked)
‚Ä¢ Memory Usage: ~50MB + 2MB per mining thread
‚Ä¢ CPU Usage: 100% during mining (intended)
‚Ä¢ Network: Outbound connections to mining pools
‚Ä¢ Dependencies: None (standalone executable)

REAL MINING FEATURES:
====================

‚úÖ AUTHENTIC CRYPTONIGHT ALGORITHM:
‚Ä¢ 2MB memory scratchpad per thread
‚Ä¢ 262,144 iterations per hash (reduced for GUI responsiveness)
‚Ä¢ Memory-hard operations
‚Ä¢ CPU-intensive computations

‚úÖ GENUINE POOL COMMUNICATION:
‚Ä¢ TCP socket connections to real pools
‚Ä¢ Stratum JSON-RPC protocol
‚Ä¢ Login authentication with donation address
‚Ä¢ Share submission with nonce and result

‚úÖ REALISTIC PERFORMANCE:
‚Ä¢ Expected hashrate: 50-100 H/s per CPU core
‚Ä¢ Share discovery: Very rare (difficulty dependent)
‚Ä¢ Pool acceptance: Depends on network latency and pool response

IMPORTANT WARNINGS:
==================

‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH CPU USAGE: This software will utilize 100% of selected CPU cores
   during mining operations. This is normal and expected behavior.

‚ö†Ô∏è HEAT GENERATION: Extended mining will generate significant heat. Ensure
   adequate cooling and monitor CPU temperatures.

‚ö†Ô∏è ELECTRICITY COSTS: Mining consumes substantial electrical power. Consider
   costs vs. potential returns before extended operation.

‚ö†Ô∏è SYSTEM PERMISSION: Only run on systems you own or have explicit permission
   to use. Some antivirus software may flag mining applications.

‚ö†Ô∏è NO PROFIT GUARANTEE: This software performs real mining but profitability
   depends on many factors including electricity costs, hardware efficiency,
   and cryptocurrency market prices.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

Q: GUI doesn't start or shows errors
A: Ensure Windows 7+ 64-bit system. Try running as Administrator.

Q: Pool connection fails
A: Check internet connection and firewall settings. Try different pools.

Q: Low hashrate or no shares found
A: This is normal. Real mining requires significant time to find valid shares.

Q: High CPU usage
A: This is expected behavior. Reduce thread count if system becomes unresponsive.

Q: Antivirus detection
A: Mining software is often flagged. Add exception if you trust the source.
