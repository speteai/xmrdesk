TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
=========================

🔧 BINARY EMBEDDING:
• XMRig executable embedded using objcopy
• 6.3MB binary data compiled into EXE
• Extracted using C++ std::ofstream
• Temporary file management

💻 INTEGRATION PROCESS:
1. objcopy converts xmrig.exe to object file
2. Linked directly into final executable
3. Runtime extraction to current directory
4. Process spawning with pipe communication
5. Output parsing for GUI updates

📊 MONITORING:
• Real-time hashrate from XMRig output
• Share acceptance/rejection tracking
• Pool connection status monitoring
• Mining log with timestamps
• Process lifecycle management
